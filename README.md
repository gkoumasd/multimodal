### This repository includes text-based and visual-models for computing textual and visual similarity respectively.

## Image Similarity
### Models
* VGG19 Feature Extractor:

This allows you to extract deep visual features for the NUS-WIDE-Lite dataset from a pre-trained VGG-19 net on the image-net dataset (1.2 million pictures).  The feature extractor computes a 4096 dimensional feature vector for every image that contains the activations of the hidden layer immediately before the VGG's object classifier.

* Extended VGG19 Feature Extractor:

* Fine-tuning VGG19 Feature Extractor:
